# easytable

This is a small project that builds upon
[Apache's PDFBox](http://pdfbox.apache.org) (>= 3.0.0) and should allow you
to create tables in a fairly simple way.
It emerged from the need in another project. Therefore, it also may miss some
crucial features. Nevertheless, there is:

* setting font and font size, table, row, column and cell level
* line breaking and line spacing
* background color and style on table, row, column and cell level
* padding (top, bottom, left, right) on table, row and cell level
* border color, width and style (on table, row or cell level)
* support for text alignment (right, left, center, justified)
* vertical text alignment (top, middle, bottom)
* column spanning and row spanning 
* images in cells
* allowing for a lot of customizations
* experimental: vertical text, drawing a large table's 
overflow on the same page

One can also override classes that are responsible for table/cell drawing, i.e. 
their drawing behaviour can be customized to a pretty high extent.

It is also possible to draw a table over multiple pages (even with the 
header row being repeated on every new page) or to draw a large table's overflow 
next to the already existing table on the same page (see below for examples).

## Installation

Add this to your `pom.xml`:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>com.github.vandeseer</groupId>
        <artifactId>easytable</artifactId>
        <version>1.0.3-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>

Or checkout the repository and install it locally with maven (e.g. for the`develop` branch):

    mvn clean install -DskipTests -Dgpg.skip -Ddependency-check.skip=true

## Examples

There is a [minimal full working example](src/test/java/org/vandeseer/MinimumWorkingExample.java) 
which should help you to get started.  

For a bit more involved tables have a look at [this code](src/test/java/org/vandeseer/integrationtest/ExcelLikeExampleTest.java) 
which is needed for creating a PDF document with the following two tables:

![easytable table](doc/example.png)

![easytable table](doc/example2.png)

For the next example have a look at the [SettingsTest.java](src/test/java/org/vandeseer/integrationtest/settings/SettingsTest.java):

![easytable table](doc/example3.png)

The last one illustrates the use of vertical text in text cells. The code for 
it can be found [here](src/test/java/org/vandeseer/integrationtest/VerticalTextCellTest.java):

![easytable table](doc/example4.png)

Drawing the overflow of a large table on the same page is also [possible](src/test/java/org/vandeseer/integrationtest/OverflowOnSamePageTableDrawerTest.java): 

![easytable table](doc/example_overflow_on_same_page.png)

If you run the tests with `mvn clean test` there also some PDF documents created which you can find in the `target` folder.
The corresponding sources (in order to understand how to use the code) can be found in the test package.

## Q&A

### Can I use the library with version PDFBox 2.x.x?

Every version of easytable < 1.0.0 is built on PDFBox 2.x.x. 

Note that easytable 1.0.0 and below
do basically only differ in the support PDFBox version, but 
not in their feature set. Only exception being the experimental support
for paragraph cells which had to be dropped with the upgrade to PDFBox 3. 

Also note that easytable >= 1.0.0 is built for Java 11 and higher, whereas
lower versions are using Java 8. 

### Can I customize the drawers for my own specific needs?

Yep, you can customize the cell drawers itself or (depending on your use case)
you can just create a custom cell. 

For using a customized cell drawer, have a look at 
[CustomCellDrawerTest](src/test/java/org/vandeseer/integrationtest/custom/CustomCellDrawerTest.java).

In case you want to create your own type of cell (which shouldn't really be necessary since the 
drawing can be completely adapted) you will need to use [Lombok](https://projectlombok.org/)'s `@SuperBuilder`
annotation. Again, just have a look at the code: 
[CustomCellWithCustomDrawerUsingLombokTest](src/test/java/org/vandeseer/integrationtest/custom/CustomCellWithCustomDrawerUsingLombokTest.java)

### Can I draw a table over multiple pages?

Yes, have a look at [TableOverSeveralPagesTest.java](src/test/java/org/vandeseer/integrationtest/TableOverSeveralPagesTest.java).
Just use `startY(...)`  and `endY(..)` in order to restrict the vertical part of the page 
where the table should be drawn: 

    RepeatedHeaderTableDrawer.builder()
        .table(createTable())
        .startX(50)
        .startY(100F)
        .endY(50F) // <-- If the table is bigger, a new page is started
        .build()

### Is there a way to repeat the header on every page?

Depending on whether you want to repeat the header row or not you 
should use `RepeatedHeaderTableDrawer` or `TableDrawer` respectively.

### Can I get the `y` coordinate of the end of a drawn table?

Yes. Just use the `.getFinalY()` method. Also see [FinalYTest.java](src/test/java/org/vandeseer/integrationtest/FinalYTest.java).

### Cool, I like it, can I buy you a beer?

Yes. Or you can upvote this answer on [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28059563/how-to-create-table-using-apache-pdfbox/42612456#42612456). Or:
